# About Integration
This is a webhook-based message forwarding integration that takes messages from a Telex channel and sends them to a Discord server using Discord Webhooks. Here's a detailed breakdown:

### Category: Output Integration
This integration takes data from Telex and sends it to Discord, it falls under output integration (i.e., forwarding data to an external platform).

### Integration Name: Telex to Discord Webhook
The name is clear and directly explains the function of the integration.
It can tweak it slightly for better readability, e.g., "Telex-to-Discord Message Forwarding" or "Telex to Discord Webhook Bridge."

### Integration Type: Webhook-based message forwarding
The integration works via webhooks, meaning:
- It listens for new messages on a Telex channel.
- It then forwards those messages to a Discord server using a Discord Webhook URL.

### Description:
- Functionality: Captures messages from Telex and forwards them to Discord.
- How it works: Listens for new messages in a Telex channel, extracts the content, and posts it in a Discord server.

ðŸš€ Possible Enhancements for Clarity: "This integration enables real-time message forwarding from a Telex channel to a Discord server using Discord Webhooks. It listens for new messages in Telex, extracts their content, and sends them directly to a specified Discord channel. Ideal for teams that rely on Discord for communication and want to stay updated with Telex messages instantly."

When a new message appears in Telex, the webhook captures it and sends it to Discord.
